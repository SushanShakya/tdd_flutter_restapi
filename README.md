# Test Driven Development in Flutter

## Wanna Start TDD ? 
## This repo is the perfect example


## How to start writing the app ?

<p>
Remember, Coding is the last thing that you'll do.
The first thing that you should do is gather requirements.

Once you know what you need you'll have the sense of the 
bussiness logic. With that you'll know exactly what you need 
in your app.

So, This way, before coding stuff you already know what the structure
of the code should look like.

That's where you start.
</p>

## What to do and what not to do ?

Look, I don't want you to have to run the "Flutter Project" to
actually see if your code works. In fact, I don't want your app to
depend upon Flutter in the first place. This might feel weird at first.
But don't worry it will all make sense once you start doing it.

So, you start with what you need in the app.

## Case Study

Consider, this repo as a example.
The only thing I want to do in the app I've built in this repo is
that we want to fetch the users and we want to create a user.

These 2 things are called the "usecases" of the app.
They are also sometimes called as "user stories".

Basically, it talks about what a user should be able to do in the app.

Once you have the user stories you start building your app from abstractions.
First, you decide what you want. Like in this case, we want a "UserRepo" which 
can somehow give us a list of users and also somehow create a user.
